Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.

Sounds boring. Let's try again.

**Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one.**

Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town _or your money back!_ With each keystroke in your command prompt, you'll take advantage of the hundreds of powerful plugins and beautiful themes. Strangers will come up to you in caf√©s and ask you, _"that is amazing! are you some sort of genius?"_

Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you have always felt you deserved. ...or maybe you'll use the time that you're saving to start flossing more often. üò¨

### Prerequisites

- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) should be installed (v4.3.9 or more recent is fine but we prefer 5.0.8 and newer). If not pre-installed (run `zsh --version` to confirm), check the following wiki instructions here: [Installing ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
- `curl` or `wget` should be installed
- `git` should be installed (recommended v2.4.11 or higher)

### Basic Installation

Oh My Zsh is installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the command-line with either `curl`, `wget` or another similar tool.

| Method    | Command                                                                                           |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **curl**  | `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"` |
| **wget**  | `sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`   |
| **fetch** | `sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"` |

Alternatively, the installer is also mirrored outside GitHub. Using this URL instead may be required if you're in a country like China or India (for certain ISPs), that blocks `raw.githubusercontent.com`:

| Method    | Command                                                                                           |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **curl**  | `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://install.ohmyz.sh/)"`                                                 |
| **wget**  | `sh -c "$(wget -O- https://install.ohmyz.sh/)"`                                                   |
| **fetch** | `sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://install.ohmyz.sh/)"`                                                 |

_Note that any previous `.zshrc` will be renamed to `.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh`. After installation, you can move the configuration you want to preserve into the new `.zshrc`._
